# Git_Exercise
Project exercise for INFO 4190

Steps Completed:

* Come up with a small programming exercise for yourself (write a sortable array in Java or something simple)
* Set up git on your machine, create a GitHub account, and create a new repo for this exercise.
* Think of at least 2 independent features that your exercise will accomplish. For the sortable array, it could be sorting a list of integers and sorting a list of strings.
* Clone the repository locally, so now you can work offline on your own machine. But be sure to still follow the git process even if it's only you working on your machine for this exercise.
* Set up branches for each of these features; this means you must have at least three branches, including master.
* Push each of these new branches to GitHub and observe they exist in the branch list.
